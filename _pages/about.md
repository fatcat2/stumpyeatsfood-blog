This is Ryan's food blog. Away from the reporting, the coding and everything else we have this: a platform for me to share my thoughts on food and restaurants and travelling abroad.

I'm a student at Purdue University who was pressured into writing a food blog after talking about restaurants too much in religion class. That hobby eventually gave way to working at my campus newspaper, The Purdue Exponent, where I requested to write food reviews but was politely shut down and offered the role of a reporter.

If you have a suggestion for some food, please email me at [ryanjchen2@gmail.com](mailto:ryanjchen2@gmail.com)! If you want to check out some pictures of food, please checkout my Instagram at [@stumpyeatsfood](instagram.com/stumpyeatsfood)!
