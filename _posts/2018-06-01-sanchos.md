The first time I can here it was like 10 years ago - the only thing I remember was that there was a bit of a wait and the chairs were super high. Well I was right about one of those things.

According to their website, Sancho's has been in the area since 2005 and is described as an "authentic Mexican eatery" - something that I can agree with. When you walk in, you're greeted by the colorful walls - painted in red, blue and adorned with articles about Sancho's popularity in the Bay. Right above the articles is a large menu written on chalkboard that just screams homey and authentic. To be honest, the simple but diverse color scheme really enticed me and got me in a great mood after struggling with Palo Alto traffic for twenty minutes.

One thing to note though: it was like 80 degrees earlier today and super hot outside, but the ceiling fans in Sancho's did their job just fine.

I think one thing of note here are the bathrooms. I'm gonna be honest - I have never seen such a contrast between bathroom and restaurant. Usually, it goes the other way: nice/acceptable restaurant setting and dirty bathroom. I'm not sure if I was tired or if all five of my senses were playing tricks on me because when I entered the dimly lit, extremely clean and air-conditioned bathroom, I couldn't help but stand and stare at the place. Like, what the hell? Are you serious???

Anyway, onto the food.

I decided to sit down and get one of their (according to Sancho's website) famous Baja style fish tacos and the thing I got when I came here ten years earlier. When you look at the taco it's pretty nice - I've written about Torchy's Tacos in Houston on here and I like their tacos even though I cried from the spiciness. As opposed to that onslaught of pain, Sancho's tacos are made to complement the little fried shrimps and fried chunks of fish they put in there. The tomato garnish is cooling, and everything comes together in a nice neat package that can be eaten in a way that doesn't involve everything just falling out.

So overall, I like this place. It's cheap for the Bay Area at about $4.50 per taco, and the atmosphere in general is pretty enjoyable. It's nice and casual, and there's ample natural lighting, making this a great lunch spot to hang out. Next time I hang out in Downtown Palo Alto, I think I'll make a return visit and try some of their horchatas and carnitas (the other thing they're famous for).
