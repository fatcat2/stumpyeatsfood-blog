### My time in the wonderful town of Greencastle.

Greencastle is definitely a town. With a population of 10,000 people, the town is home to Depauw University and one of my close friends at the Exponent: Alex Weliever. Alex lives a few miles outside of the city and graciously let me stay at her house while I waited for my flight on Monday (dorms kicked us out on Sunday at noon so I had to find a place to stay). So big thanks to Alex.

Though going to Greencastle was fun, I had to say goodbye to a lot of my friends in West Lafayette - so whom I've known since before starting at Purdue! A bunch of them are staying at Purdue over the summer in order to take classes and hopefully catch up to me so we can all get in the same Systems Programming section!

Anyway, accompanying us over the weekend was Alisa Reynya, the Exponent's wonderful managing editor who ate with me at Triple XXX. Alex and Alisa are staying in West Lafayette to work at the Exponent.

I'm going home.

We first got to Alex's house and put down our things. After a quick introduction to Echo the dog, we skedaddled on down to downtown to get some sandwiches at Tap House 24.

When you enter, it's clearly a more modern looking place. It has that new gentrified industrial look, with black-painted metal chairs with nice wooden seats, and seating at the window. Actually, it's usually a wall but it's a garage door that lifts up! Really seems like a re-purposed garage at this point. The atmosphere inside was quiet when we went on Sunday afternoon - though it was during off-peak hours so I'm not really surprised.

Alex and Alisa were a little more decisive than I - with Alex grabbing a Tap Tenderloin and Alisa getting her hands on a Pub Cheesesteak. I settled with the The Murphy - a nice burger with a pretzel bun. All three costed us $10-12 - and this was with the addition of either waffle fries or fries and a pickle spear - which Alex and Alisa gladly let me eat.

First off, I thought the portion sizing was pretty decent. Though it was on the expensive side, I'll let it slide since it is a nice area and Depauw is pretty close. So Greencastle is kind of a college town? Debatable.

The pretzel bun had a sweeter flavor than the normal bun, which I appreciate. Normal buns tend to not add a lot besides structure and a bit of texture, so having the savory flavors of the pretzel bun added a bit to the sandwich. Though, in adding the flavors, it wasn't crunchy at all - but that's more of a subjective thing. When you bite into the sandwich, you first encounter the sweetness of the bun. But as you travel down, you hit the bacon and the cheese and the patty, giving you more and more flavor as the sauce drips down the other side of the sandwich.

Needless to say, I cleaned the guy up real quick. And the Cajun chips that I got with it. At first they weren't really spicy, but as I kept eating them the spice level really built up. After I felt the prickling embers of the Cajun chips tickling my mouth, I got to smother with a nice crunchy pickle spear. Yum yum yeet.

After our time at Tap House 24, Alex brought us on a little tour of the local university: Depauw. Well known for its music program, it's got some stellar architecture and a pretty nifty library along with some cool lawn chairs you can just plop down in and read the entire front section of the New York Times in (hint: that's what we ended up doing).

Depauw is curious, in how it's mostly a music and liberal arts school. As a computer science major at a decidedly engineering-focused school (Purdue), it's interesting to see what is focused based on the number of buildings dedicated to each type of academia. It's also a seriously beautiful campus compared to Purdue. While Armstrong and Wilemelth Active Learning Center and Lawson are pretty cool, none compare to the amount of natural light used.

After our little tour through the small university, we went to Scoops ice cream downtown to witness Alex's sister's first day of work. Way to scoop that ice cream Gretchen!
