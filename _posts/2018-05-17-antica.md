So I'm finally back in the Bay Area and ready to try some bomb-ass food but as it turns out a particular pizza join also recently made its' way back a week after I did. So yeah, Pizza Antica is back in action.

According to my foodie friend Winnie, Pizza Antica used to be the spot to go to but for reasons currently unknown to me it closed for a while. Thankfully, we happened upon the high-end pizza spot right as on their first day of reopening.

My first impression when opening the door was that these waiters are really fashionable. Like, if you opened some sort of magazine or fashion-Instagram page you'd expect to see these guys. And a few things hinted at a grand reopening in retrospect - a very fashionably dressed but definitely kind of confused employee trying to find the reservations iPad and me and Winnie never getting our reservations text. Let me preface everything with one fun fact: it feels like time moves slower in Anthropologie. While waiting for a table to open up, we decided to check out the shop and look around while waiting (fun fact, the last time I was in that store I finished reading a book). And boy does time seem to slow in there.

If felt like a whole YEAR.

If anybody else feels this way please let me know I can't be the only one.

Back to the pizza - after finally getting a seat outside, Winnie and I ordered our pizzas. Now I'm not a big fan of expensive stuff. If something is priced low it somehow tastes better. These pies costed $20 each.

Soooo yeah mark this down as pretty rough on the wallet.

First of all, the heirloom potato pizza with prosciutto. Don't worry, that's not all that adorned the thin-crust pizza. Accompanied by some truffle oil and and caramelized onions, I thought it was an interesting (albeit gourmet) take on the standard meat and potatoes combo. The combo was honestly an original taste - I don't think I've experienced anything like that before. I remember the texture of the potatoes accompanied by the cheese and the slight taste of truffles from the oil. The thin crust was also an interesting option - I'm not exactly sure if I can call this California pizza but we'll see.

I also got to taste a bit of Winnie's, which tasted more like traditional pizza and didn't really have that much cheese (but did have some smoked caciocavallo). Mixed with the onion and the fennel sausage, I have to say that this was my favorite of the two. Not just because the flabor was less foreign to me, but - okay yeah that's why I liked it better. In my opinion, Pizza tastes better with sauce.

Overall, here's how it stacks up:

Recommend? *Yes, for a nice night out.*

Expensive? *Ouch. Maybe if you share a pizza?*

Return visit? *We'll see, maybe if I win the lottery or something lol.*
I ordered an heirloom potato pizza with added prosciutto while Winnie ordered a pepperoni pizza (don't worry it was more than just cheese and pepperoni), and I have to say that I was pretty happy with what I ordered. First a shoutout to the absolutely amazing service they have there - your guys' attention to detail just made the entire meal better than it already was.
