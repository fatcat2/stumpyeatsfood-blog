Indiana can be really depressing - especially during finals week. The cold really gets to you, and the lack of snow doesn’t exactly help either. I’m not really sure why I’m saying this. It might be because I don’t want to go back to Indiana because it’s going to be freezing when I do get back.

But anyway, welcome back to the blog boys and girls. These few weeks are going to be startlingly amazing and delicious. Let’s start with my first food excursion out: getting back together with the food squad for a great day in the South Bay.

Skateboarding down Grant Ave isn’t exactly the easiest thing: for one, there aren’t really any sidewalks. But I made it down to Athena’s house, where Albert and Junghyun picked us up to get going to our first destination: Bell Tower Cafe. While there is no shortage of breakfast spots in Los Altos - Tom’s Depot, The Original Pancake House, etc. - the overwhelming amount of choices can cause one to pause and be paralyzed by too many options. Why are there so many breakfast spots in Los Altos? Does this mean Mountain View is designated as the lunch and dinner city? Why does everything close before 10pm? Is this what it feels like to live in a rural town? Does Los Altos count as rural?

So many questions.

After helping the newly-licensed Albert navigate along Foothill Expressway in post-rush hour traffic, we turned into the Rancho Shopping Center to eat at the Bell Tower Cafe. I’m not gonna lie - I found this one on Yelp and I had actually heard of it before but I thought it was either in Los Gatos or Palo Alto. Turns out it was living right under my nose the entire time. According to Yelp, the Bell Tower Cafe is rated at 4.5 stars over 23 reviews, which really isn’t bad. And I have to say that the food wasn’t bad either: I ordered the Lancer (for my high school’s mascot!), which is a big omelette with the side of toast and potatoes for about $14.50. The first thing you might say after hearing that is wow that’s a lot of money. And I may respond by saying: first this is Los Altos - good luck getting anything here for cheap - and then I will say it was actually kind of worth it.

 Maybe it was just me being used to dorm food.

 Maybe it was just me being soft on restaurants.

But regardless, there me and my Asian-American buds (and one kind of Canadian) sat among a plethora of Caucasian folks that looked like they had been living there for at least three or four of my life spans, eating our omelettes (Albert ate a short stack), catching up with each other, and making fun of Athena who thought it was cold (she goes to school in SoCal). Albert and I go to school in the Midwest - and it is pretty freaking cold over there. Anyway, The Lancer is a conglomerate of egg, spinach, bacon, tomato and cheese that works really well together. When you bite down into the yellow mound (or what constitutes as a hill in Indiana)  you get a little bit of that cheese and a little bit of that texture when you crunch down on some bacon. The cheese pools down under the mound like an underground spring of gold - forcing you to really dig down and stab into that omelette to get a bit of cheese. Otherwise, it was a great experience: it’s got a nice atmosphere, has huge omelettes, and is mostly good all around.

 I would say that this is a must-have, but if you’re strapped for options in Los Altos and you’re ashamed that the waiters at Tom’s know your name (they don’t know mine but I’m working on it), you might as well stop by.
