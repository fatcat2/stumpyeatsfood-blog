So I just got back from good old Purdue after a less-than-stellar semester attempting to obtain my degree in computer science. But never mind that! Let’s leave the negativity behind until grades get posted! Let’s go to the ever-popular and trendy Sizzling Lunch! According to their Facebook page, Sizzling Lunch is an attempt to put a modern spin on Teppanyaki.

“We provide our customers a delicious meal served on a hot iron plate that maintains the best temperature, and brushed with a little butter to give the most savory bite,” writes the Sizzling Lunch PR person on their Facebook page. And that they do: when I ordered my Curry Beef Rice with Cheese, all the materials to make it were neatly arranged on a sizzling hot stone plate. That is, the raw materials. So instead of the watching the Teppanyaki performance, you are the performer sans the onion volcano.

Initially, I was a little confused and frankly worried about accidentally leaving some of the beef raw and getting sick. Luckily, Sizzling Lunch made the decision to post instructions behind the counter, reminding customers to take care of the protein first and likely escaping liability in the case of raw meat consumption.

It was smooth sailing after that. The rice mixed with the butter and other ingredients was creamy, but lacked any taste of the curry. Maybe I’m taste-blind, but I really couldn’t taste the curry powder that was sprinkled on my stack. I did see at the bottom of the menu that add-ons for extra curry powder were $0.50 extra, but I wasn’t too keen on paying that money. I must’ve been really taste blind because I added some pepper onto my meal afterwards and it still didn’t taste that much different. Maybe there was too much butter? Whatever was going on, was not my cup of tea.

Overall, if you’re feeling kind of adventurous and want try out some fusion, this place will fit your needs. It’s got the potentially iconic white wrapper around the plate for the Instagram clout to alert your followers that yes, you are there.
