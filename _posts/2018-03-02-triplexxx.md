f you've been to Purdue, you've definitely heard of the Triple XXX family restaurant. Located on the corner of State and Salisbury, this cute little eatery has been the staple of West Lafayette since - wait for it - 1929. That's right Boilermakers and whoever else is reading this: this restaurant is kinda as old as Pappy's. While also a classic, Triple XXX is the one that really stands out to me.

So my friend Alisa (the entertainment editor at the Purdue Exponent check out her latest article) and I decided to hit up Triple XXX after payday to see what all the hype was about. I had actually been to Triple XXX when I first visited, but that was back when I was concussed out of my mind and I didn't know anything at all about Purdue. According to my other friend Molly, the sweet potato fries are the best things to eat there. Well, sorry Molly. Alisa and I didn't know that. What we did do was get a taste of their cold, specialty root beer.

That's right, root beer. We're underage, we don't drink alcohol.

But apparently neither does the rest of Indiana. According to the their menu, Triple XXX's root beer is touted as "Indiana's most iconic root beer." While I didn't know that was a thing, I can say that it tasted pretty good. Definitely better than the fountain soda they have down at Hot Box. When you walk into Triple XXX, one of the things that you'll immediately notice is probably cash only. Just kidding, but it is cash only with a nice little ATM in the corner. The design of the place echoes that of a retro bar - with those thin strips of metal lining with the menus tucked in behind the plastic napkin holders. The sunlight pours in from a huge window, spilling onto vinyl seats and a few (presumably) tired college students looking to get a taste of the 1920s. And they are not the only ones who have visited this establishment of late.

According to the Triple XXX website, the orange-and-black establishment was visited by the one and only mayor of Flavortown: Guy Fieri. That's right: THE Guy Fieri walked in the same little aisles I walked in. I feel so honored. Anyway, I'm not sure what Guy Fieri thought of the place because I didn't watch the video but I did know that Alisa and I had a few opinions on our burgers of choice.

Before walking in, I just knew I had to get the Duane Pervis All-American. Featuring a quarter-pound of beef, the burger includes all the classics including a healthy spread of peanut butter?

Peanut butter? What?

But as it turns out, this isn't even the first time I've had this. I can distinctly remember eating this during my time in Taipei this past summer. That's right - an American classic smack dab in Asia. But I have tasted it before and I have to say it's not bad. The creamy peanut butter definitely adds texture and a great umami flavor to the burger. Working along with the cheese, the two create a great flavor that combine with the crunchiness of the rest of the burger. In the first bite, you bite through the bun, the cool lettuce and tomato and crunch through the bacon to get into the cheese, meat, and the oh-so-creamy peanut butter. Along with the burgers, Alisa and I each enjoyed a cold one in a chilled glass mug. Filled to the brim with their classic root beer, there was definitely a different taste than A&W Root Beer. While it was different in a pleasing way, I can't really describe it.

Despite all these great things, I did find some drawbacks to the burgers.

Alisa pointed out that the bread could have been higher quality. I too had issues with the buns: when compressing the bread, it felt lower quality than burgers served elsewhere. Then again: this could be a thing of tradition and I'm spewing tons of blasphemy. On the other hand, when the sandwich is held in the hand the bun starts to tear apart - something that I've long associated with cheaper buns from Costco.

Long story short, I'd rate my meal a 4.5/5. I love the peanut butter taste, and the root beer did also add a nice nostalgic touch to the meal. In addition, the fries were crispy and I got all this for around $12. Whether you think this is expensive for root beer, fries and a top-notch burger that has been featured on the Food Network is completely up to you. What I do know is that I'll definitely be back.
